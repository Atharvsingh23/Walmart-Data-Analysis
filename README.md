This project presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline for Walmart sales data.
The goal is to derive critical business insights by combining:

Python → For data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering.

PostgreSQL → For advanced querying, storage, and relational analysis.

SQL → To answer structured business questions.

EDA techniques → To uncover trends, anomalies, and customer behavior.

The analysis is inspired by real-world retail analytics practices, where businesses must continuously evaluate sales performance, profitability, and customer preferences to optimize operations and strategies.

While PostgreSQL is the primary database for this project, the pipeline is flexible enough to work with MySQL as well.

🎯 Objectives

This project is designed to:

Process raw data into a structured and clean dataset.

Load data into PostgreSQL to build an analytical database.

Solve business problems using complex SQL queries.

Provide actionable insights such as:

Revenue growth across branches.

Best-selling products and categories.

Customer purchase patterns (time, city, payment methods).

Profitability by branch and category.

🏗 Workflow
1. Data Collection

Dataset downloaded using Kaggle API.

Stored in data/ folder for reproducibility.

2. Data Exploration (EDA)

Used Pandas functions (.info(), .describe(), .value_counts()) to understand structure.

Identified missing values, data types, and distribution.

3. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and nulls.

Converted columns to correct formats (e.g., dates → datetime).

Standardized currency and price formats.

4. Feature Engineering

Created Total_Amount = Unit_Price * Quantity.

Added additional calculated fields for better SQL aggregation.

5. Database Integration

Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.

Verified table creation and successful record insertion.

Made the project MySQL-compatible if needed.

6. SQL Analysis

Business problems solved with advanced SQL queries:

Revenue Analysis → Trends across time, branch, and category.

Best-Selling Products → Top items by units sold and revenue.

Customer Behavior → Preferred payment methods, shopping hours.

Profitability → Profit margin analysis segmented by category and branch.

7. Documentation & Publishing

Well-structured README and notebooks for transparency.

SQL queries stored in sql_queries/ directory.

Python scripts (main.py) for automation.

📊 Results & Insights

From the analysis, we obtained:

Sales Insights → Branches and product categories with the highest sales volume.

Profitability → Key categories driving revenue and margins.

Customer Trends → Insights into preferred payment methods (Cash, Credit, E-wallet), peak purchase hours, and city-wise variations.

These insights help businesses optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve profitability.

🙌 Acknowledgments

Dataset → Walmart Sales Data (Kaggle).

Inspiration → Walmart’s business case studies on retail optimization.

✨ This project bridges the gap between raw sales data and business decision-making by combining data engineering, SQL, and analytics into a single, reproducible pipeline.

👉 Do you want me to design a clean workflow diagram in PNG/SVG (with steps: Data → Cleaning → PostgreSQL → SQL Analysis → Insights) so you can directly attach it in your GitHub repo instead of using a placeholder image link?
